# FreeFile
This was made with tkinter and python.

It alowes you to upload a file and a a 2 letter code (such as FB or XH) anyone in the world can then download your file by putting in the code.
with the codes only being 2 letters long, means only 729 files can exist at once and the code can easily be copied and pasted.

This means it has the following advantages:

no web-browser needed.
Codes are VERY easy to remember, and share.

But there are also the following DISadvanatges:

No security, you have no way to prevent other random people from downloading your files.
NO SECURITY there's no way to check weather the file your downloading is a virus or not (maybe do virus scans).
your file may not stay on the servers as it can quickly be replaced by other files.


How to use:

  Uploading files:
    
    Click the upload button.
    Select the file you want to upload and click done.
    once it finishes uploading the code will apear in the text box.
    Give this code to your friends.
    
  Downloading files:
    
    First put the 2 letter code (in capatals) into the textbox (it's a cream color)
    Click download and choose where you want it to be downloaded and click done.
    That's it
    
  Updateing Free File:
    
    the process is different on mac nd windows.
    
    On windows type "update" into the text box then click the download button.
    Once it finishes downloading close and reopen Free File.
    You'll notice that a file called FREEFILE244OLDTEMP will have been "created" that's just the old exe and will be
    automaticly deleted by the new EXE.
    
    On macs, you need to get the latest version from this GitHub page, sorry, it's just harder to do on macOS. XD

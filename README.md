NOTE: Servers are closed indefenitly, if you wish to host a server then you are free to do so. But you will need to distribute your own code as the address is baked into the code.

# FreeFile
[Windows Build](WindowsBuild.zip)
<br>
[MacOS Build](MacBuild.zip)
<br>
<br>
This was made with Tkinter and Python.
<br>
<br>
It allows you to upload a file and receive a 2-letter code (such as FB or XH) anyone in the world can then download your file by putting in the code.
with the codes only being 2 letters long, means only 729 files can exist at once and the code can easily be copied and pasted.
<br>
<br>
This means it has the following advantages:
<br>
no web browser is needed.
Codes are VERY easy to remember, and share.
<br>
<br>
But there are also the following disadvantages:
<br>
No security, you have no way to prevent other random people from downloading your files.
NO SECURITY There's no way to check whether the file you downloading is a virus or not (maybe do virus scans).
your file may not stay on the servers as it can quickly be replaced by other files.
<br>
<br>
How to use:
<br>
<br>
  Uploading files:
    
    Click the upload button.
    Select the file you want to upload and click Done.
    once it finishes uploading the code will appear in the text box.
    Give this code to your friends.
<br>
<br>
  Downloading files:
    
    First, put the 2-letter code (in capitals) into the textbox (it's a cream color)
    Click download and choose where you want it to be downloaded and click done.
    That's it
<br>
<br>
  Updating Free File:
    
    the process is different on Mac and Windows.
    
    On Windows type "update" into the text box then click the download button.
    Once it finishes downloading close and reopen Free File.
    You'll notice that a file called FREEFILE244OLDTEMP will have been "created" that's
    just the old exe and will be automatically deleted by the new EXE.
    
    On Macs, you need to get the latest version from this GitHub page, sorry, it's 
    just harder to do on macOS. XD
